<strong>AI in Science and Research</strong>AI is making lots of progress in the scientific sector. Artificial Intelligence can handle large quantities of data and processes it quicker than human minds. This makes it perfect for research where the sources contain high data volumes.

AI is already making breakthroughs in this field. A great example is ‘Eve,’ which is an AI-based robot. It discovered an ingredient of toothpaste that can cure a dangerous disease like Malaria. Imagine a common substance present in an everyday item that is capable of treating Malaria; it’s a significant breakthrough, no doubt. 

Drug discovery is a fast-growing sector, and AI is aiding the researchers considerably in this regard. Biotechnology is another field where researchers are using AI to design microorganisms for industrial applications. Science is witnessing significant changes thanks to AI and ML. Learn more about the benefits of AI. <br>
<strong>AI in Cyber Security: </strong> Cybersecurity is another field that’s benefitting from AI. As organizations are transferring their data to IT networks and cloud, the threat of hackers is becoming more significant.
Cognitive AI is an excellent example of this field. It detects and analyses threats, while also providing insights to the analysts for making better-informed decisions. By using Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning networks, the AI gets better and more durable over time. This makes it capable of fighting more advanced threats that might develop with them.  <br>
<strong>AI in Data Analysis: </strong> Data analysis can benefit largely from AI and ML. AI algorithms are capable of improving with iterations, and this way, their accuracy, and precision increase accordingly. AI can help data analysts with handling and processing large datasets. <br>
<strong>AI in Transport: </strong> The transport sector has been using AI for decades. Airplanes have been using autopilot to steer them in the air since 1912. An autopilot system controls the trajectory of a plane, but it isn’t restricted to aircraft alone. Ships and spacecraft also use autopilot to help them maintain the correct course. <br>
<strong>AI in Home :  </strong>AI has found a special place in people’s homes in the form of Smart Home Assistants. Amazon Echo and Google Home are popular smart home devices that let you perform various tasks with just voice commands. <br>
